				"5": "The grey cell represents an empty hook.",
				"6": "If the upper half of a grey cell is colored light blue, it means that the cell should not be hung with products due to the shape switching constraint; if the lower half is colored green, it means that the cell should not be hung with products due to the color switching constraint."
